## How to setup

### First, download the compressed yoga folder 
When exporting, make sure to call the golder 'yoga' : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-vz4RgA-VMX3J1UXMpWwZGkLEoutOdIs/view?usp=share_link

### Second, download pytorch models from drive
Place exported files into the model folder :

### Third, you will need Python 3.7 specifically.
The easiest way to manage entire python versions is with Anaconda : https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

Once you have Anaconda installed and you have a terminal open in this repository, you can run :

```bash
# Create virtual environment
! conda create -n python=3.7 yourenv pip

# Activate your virtual environment
! conda activate yourenv

# Install dependencies
! pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Demo to confirm setup
! python demo.py
```

## Notes
I did not include torch (and torchvision) in the requirements.txt because each machine needs a specific version.

Just run pip install torch to get the basic cpu version.

I highly recommend using vscode for this as it has the ability to detect environments and allows you to easily run jupyter notebooks with them.
I believe there are some extensions you'll need for vscode. Try looking up Jupyter.
