# Data Goblins ðŸ”¥ Modeling Human Behavior With Machine Learning ðŸ¤–

## How to setup

### You will need Python 3.7 specifically.

The easiest way to manage entire python versions is with Anaconda : https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

Once you have Anaconda installed and you have a terminal open in this repository, you can run :

### Create virtual environment
! conda create -n yourenv  python=3.7 pip

### Activate your virtual environment
! conda activate yourenv

### Install dependencies
! pip install -r requirements.txt

### Install Torch
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

### Run The Webapp
! python -m webapp.py

## Notes

I highly recommend using vscode for this as it has the ability to detect environments and allows you to easily run jupyter notebooks with them.
I believe there are some extensions you'll need for vscode. Try looking up Jupyter.
