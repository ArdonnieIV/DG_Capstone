## How to setup

### First, download the compressed yoga folder

When exporting, make sure to call the folder 'yoga' : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-vz4RgA-VMX3J1UXMpWwZGkLEoutOdIs/view?usp=share_link

### Second, you will need Python 3.7 specifically.

The easiest way to manage entire python versions is with Anaconda : https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

Once you have Anaconda installed and you have a terminal open in this repository, you can run :

# Create virtual environment
! conda create -n yourenv  python=3.7 pip

# Activate your virtual environment
! conda activate yourenv

# Install dependencies
! pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run The Webapp
! python -m webapp.py

## Notes

I highly recommend using vscode for this as it has the ability to detect environments and allows you to easily run jupyter notebooks with them.
I believe there are some extensions you'll need for vscode. Try looking up Jupyter.
